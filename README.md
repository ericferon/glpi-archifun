# Functional areas (Archifun)
Archifun plugin for GLPI

This plugin enables you to manage the functional areas of your enterprise architecture and associate them with elements of the inventory.<br/>
A functional area can be decomposed in subareas, helping you to associate inventory items (typically applications) to these functions.<br/>
